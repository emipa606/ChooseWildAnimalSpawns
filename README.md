This mod is a successor to claustros mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067667371]Disable Wild Animal Spawns

The major difference is that this version allows you to define the spawn-rate per biome per animal instead of the on/off selection. 
The other difference it that you can modify any animal, vanilla and modded.

Added a slider for the overall animal density per biome as well.
Also option to copy values between biomes.
There is also a reverse option to select an animal and define spawnrate per biome.

If you need higher accuracy than what the sliders provide, try adding the  https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2218078784]BetterSliders mod
