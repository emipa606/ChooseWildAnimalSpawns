This mod is a successor of claustros mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2067667371]Disable Wild Animal Spawns

The major difference is that this version allows you to define the spawn-rate per animal per biome instead of the on/off selection. 
The other difference it that you can modify any animal, vanilla and modded.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
